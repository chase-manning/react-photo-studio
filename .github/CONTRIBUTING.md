# Contribution Guide

Hi and welcome to the Photoshop Online contribution guide!  
Thanks for considering to contribute! :tada:

## Found a Bug

If you have found a bug, great job!  
Please don't hesitate to create an Issue for it so it can be fixed.  
Please make sure to add the `bug` Label, and if appropriate, the `good first issue` Label.  
If you want to fix the bug yourself, then also assign the Issue to yourself and keep reading!

## Got a Suggestion

Suggestions to improve the website or codebase are very welcomed!  
Please first create an Issue with the idea.  
If it improves the site for visitors, assign it the `enhancement` tag, or if it is technical, then assign it the `technical` tag.

## Issues

There are a bunch of [open issues](https://github.com/chase-manning/photoshop-online/issues) that would be great if you could help with.  
Feel free to work on any issue that isn't already assigned to someone.  
Issues that are tagged with [good first issue](https://github.com/chase-manning/photoshop-online/labels/good%20first%20issue) are the best place to start.

## Development Workflow

If you are contributing, please first fork the repo.  
Make your changes in this forked repository or a branch off it until you are happy.  
And then create a PR back into Master.  
Please also link the Issue that the PR relates to, and include a screenshot of your changes if relevant

Before any PR can be merged, all tests must be passing and all visual changes must be approved in Percy.  
These are all visible within the PR view so you can easily see if there are any issues.  
Each PR will deploy the site and provide a link to the deployed version so it is easy to view your changes.
